Digital Clock Workshop: Individual

This clock uses a setInterval() to run the functions which grab the date and time and runs the functions.
The functions insert the variable information into the elements to display date and time.
The date variables are used to change the color of the elements on the page.
The browsers window.height is also grabbed to properly position the date and time.
